# Complete Web Hosting Guide üåê

## What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that allows your website to be accessible on the internet. Think of it as **renting space on a server** (a powerful computer that runs 24/7) where your website files live and can be accessed by anyone worldwide.

**Simple Analogy:** 
- Your website files = Your furniture
- Web hosting = Renting an apartment
- Domain name = Your address

**Cost:** FREE on most modern hosting platforms

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
